                We make Live, Push and Link — unique software and hardware for music creation and
                performance. With these products, our community of users creates amazing things.
            </h3>
            <p class="des-text">
                Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a
                community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

                Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s
                incredibly rewarding.
            </h3>
            <p class="des-text">
                We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for
                what we make, and the people we make it for.

            <p class="des-text">
                Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come
                from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught,
                and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the
                skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

            <p class="des-text">
                Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their
                magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
                diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with
                each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

                We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally and professionally, and we

                Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
                skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and
                music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.
